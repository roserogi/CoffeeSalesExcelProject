# CoffeeSalesExcelProject
Built an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing 5,000+ coffee sales records. Used IF, VLOOKUP, and INDEX to flag customer types, enrich data, and retrieve insights. Created pivot tables and visuals to show trends by region, roast, and year, helping identify top products and key growth markets.
